# End-to-End-ML-Project---California-housing
This is an end-to-end Machine Learning project. we would start by learning how to load a dataset, visualize it, fill in the missing values, create pipelines, handle categorical variables, train models based on that data, and finally predict using that model.  This will not only help you understand how to train a machine learning model, but will also give you a detailed idea of how to clean and prepare data for machine learning, train the model, and fine tune it in real life projects.  Skills we will develop:  scikit-learn Data visualization Treating missing values in dataset Handling categorical variables Creating transformation pipelines Training Machine Learning models  here we work on California housing dataset and train a model for their district  prediction and rent prediction .
